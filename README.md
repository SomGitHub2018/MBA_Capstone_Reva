In this paper we are performing the validation of the set of datasets to know the critical points which play major role in monitoring the diabetes. Whereby using ML concepts, we are exploring with the assistance of varied ML models like LR, GB, and concluding by using Lime and SHAP, to understand the patient model in any pre-diabetes stages diabetic, pre diabetic and nondiabetic.  NLP analyses large amount of text data and describes how to program computers to process. It is linguistics, computing and artificial intelligence Of sub-fields. Python has many libraries for natural language processing like NLTK, word cloud, Text Blob, Beautiful Soup, spaCy and so on.
